# 📊 Informatica PowerCenter Tasks

A comprehensive collection of ETL mappings and workflows demonstrating practical implementations of Informatica PowerCenter transformations. This repository showcases real-world data integration scenarios from beginner to expert level.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains hands-on exercises and implementations covering various Informatica PowerCenter transformations and techniques. Each folder represents a specific transformation type with complete mapping designs, workflows, and documentation.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. **Filter Transformation**
- Implementing data filtering based on business logic
- Conditional row selection
- Performance optimization techniques
- Use cases: Data quality checks, record validation

### 2. **Router Transformation**
- Multi-group data routing
- Complex conditional logic implementation
- Default group handling
- Use cases: Data segregation, multi-target loading

### 3. **Sequence Number Generation**
- Generating unique sequence numbers
- Surrogate key creation
- Handling sequence reset scenarios
- Use cases: Primary key generation, record numbering

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Informatica PowerCenter 9.x or higher
- PowerCenter Designer
- Workflow Manager
- Repository Service configured
- Integration Service configured

### How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
